Undirected graph
 * If any graph has -ve edge weight than both algorithm not works..

directed graph
* if andy graph has -ve edge weight cycle than 
- dijikstra may give wrong answer but don't tell that a graph has -ve edge weight cycle .. but bellman ford will tell that graph has -ve edge weight cycle.
However bellman ford and dijikstra both doesnt work for -ve edge weight cycle.

Note - -ve edge weight cycle is different from -ve edge weight .. a graph contains -ve edge weight may or may not have -ve edge weight cycle. for detecting -vedge weight
cycle we can use bellman ford algorithm..

Time complexity

Dijikstra -   E(logv) 
Bellman ford - (V*E)
where E=no. of edges and V are no. of vertices

when to use dijikstra ?
if graph is directed and you are sure about that their wont be any -ve edge weight cycle than we will definitely go to dijikstra
if graph i undirected and we know that all weights of edges are +ve than we can definitely use dijikstra

when to use Bellman ford ?
if graph is directed and you are not sure about that their wont be any -ve edge weight cycle than we will go to bellman ford algorithm.
